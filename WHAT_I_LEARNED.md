🤖 Assistant Robot Project – What I Learned

This project was developed when I was 11 years old as part of the TEKNOFEST “Technology for Humanity” competition. The goal of the project was to help elderly and disabled people carry their groceries from markets to their homes using an autonomous robot.

🛠 Technical Skills I Gained

Used Arduino as the main controller for a real-world robotics project

Worked with DC motors and L293D motor driver shield

Implemented IR sensors for obstacle detection

Learned basic power management and wiring for robotic systems

Improved hands-on electronics, assembly, and soldering skills

Integrated simple Bluetooth control for lighting and system features

🧠 Engineering & Problem-Solving Skills

Learned how to break down a real-life problem into engineering tasks

Designed a solution focused on usability and social impact

Understood the importance of testing, iteration, and simplicity

Learned that engineering is not only about building, but also about improving

👥 Project Planning & Teamwork

Planned a project timeline and followed development steps

Learned how to document a project for evaluation and reporting

Experienced working under deadlines for a national competition

⚠ Challenges & Mistakes

Faced sensor inaccuracies and unstable motor behavior

Learned debugging through trial and error

Understood that failure is part of engineering, not the end of it

🚀 How This Project Shaped Me

This was my first real engineering project solving a social problem.
It showed me that technology can directly improve people’s lives.
After this experience, I decided that I want to study Electrical and Electronic Engineering and build human-centered technology in the future.
